                What is C#?
                C# is a modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft and approved by European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) and International Standards Organization (ISO).

                C# was developed by Anders Hejlsberg and his team during the development of .Net Framework.

                C# is designed for Common Language Infrastructure (CLI), which consists of the executable code and runtime environment that allows use of various high-level languages on different computer platforms and architectures.

                The following reasons make C# a widely used professional language −

                It is a modern, general-purpose programming language
                It is object oriented.
                It is component oriented.
                It is easy to learn.
                It is a structured language.
                It produces efficient programs.
                It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms.
                It is a part of .Net Framework.

                Key Characteristics of C#
                C# comes with several key features that make it a powerful and reliable programming language:

                Object-Oriented: C# follows OOP principles, allowing the use of classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
                Type-Safe: C# is a type-safe programming language that ensures secure coding by preventing unsafe memory operations.
                Cross-Platform: C# is a cross-platform programming language that means C# works on Windows, Linux, and macOS using .NET Core.
                Scalable & Maintainable: C# is well-suited for developing large and complex applications.
                Rich Library Support: C# come with many built-in libraries for UI, database handling, and networking.
                High Performance: C# compiles to Intermediate Language (IL) and runs efficiently on the Common Language Runtime (CLR).
