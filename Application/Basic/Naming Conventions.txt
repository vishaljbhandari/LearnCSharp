Similar to .NET naming standards.

Camel Case (camelCase): In this standard, the first letter of the word always in small letter and after that each word starts with a capital letter.
Pascal Case (PascalCase): In this the first letter of every word is in capital letter.
Underscore Prefix (_underScore): For underscore ( __ ), the word after _ use camelCase terminology.


>> Namespace -> use PascalCase
namespace NextProgramming.Domain

>> Enum -> use PascalCasing
Use a singular type name for an enumeration unless its values are bit fields.
Use a plural type name for an enumeration with bit fields as values, also called flags enum.
Do not use an "Enum" suffix in enum type names.
Do not use "Flag" or "Flags" suffixes in enum type names.
Do not use a prefix on enumeration value names.  

>> Property -> Use PascalCase
Never use Get and Set as prefix with property name.
Don't use name with start with numeric character.
private int _salary = 100;  

>> Member variable -> 
Declare member variable at the top of the class
If class has static member then it will come at the top most and after that other member variable.

>> Public Member Variable -> use PascalCase
public int Salary = 100;

>> Private Member Variable -> use camelCase terminology prefix with underscore ( _ )
private int _salary = 100; 

>> Interface -> use letter "I" as prefix with name of interface. After letter I, use PascalCase.
public interface IUser {}

>> Arguments and Local Variable -> use camelCase
Dont use Hungarian notation for this
Don't use abbreviations for any words
Don't use underscore ( _ ) in between any name

>> Methods -> use PascalCase
Don't use name as all character in CAPS.
public string GetPosts(string postId)  {}

>> Class -> use PascalCase
Use noun or noun phrase for class name. 
Do not give prefixes. 
Do not use underscores.
Class name should be Singular not plural.

>> Native DataType -> Always use native datatype instead of .NET CTS type.
For example, use int instead of Int32 or Int64.
