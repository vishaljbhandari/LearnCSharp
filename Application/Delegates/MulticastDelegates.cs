            Delegate objects can be composed using the "+" operator. 
            A composed delegate calls the two delegates it was composed from. 
            Only delegates of the same type can be composed. 
            The "-" operator can be used to remove a component delegate from a composed delegate.

            Using this property of delegates you can create an invocation list of methods that will be called when a delegate is invoked. 
            This is called multicasting of a delegate.
