        Applications of Reflection
        Reflection has the following applications −
        It allows view attribute information at runtime.
        It allows examining various types in an assembly and instantiate these types.
        It allows late binding to methods and properties.
        It allows creating new types at runtime and then performs some tasks using those types.

        Namespace for Reflection
        To use reflection in your C# code, you need to include the System.Reflection namespace. Here is the syntax to include it:
